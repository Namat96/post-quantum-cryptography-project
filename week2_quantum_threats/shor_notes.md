# Shor’s Algorithm

Shor’s Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization
and discrete logarithms.

Why it is dangerous:
- Breaks RSA
- Breaks ECC
- Breaks Diffie-Hellman

Reason:
RSA security depends on factoring large numbers.
ECC depends on discrete logarithms.

Quantum computers can solve these efficiently using Shor’s Algorithm.

Conclusion:
Most classical public-key cryptosystems become insecure.
