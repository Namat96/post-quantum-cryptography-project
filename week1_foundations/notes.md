# Day 1 Notes – Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic works with remainders.

(a + b) mod q  
(a × b) mod q  
a^e mod q  

Used in:
- RSA
- ECC
- LWE
- Ring-LWE

Why important:
All cryptographic algorithms rely on modular arithmetic.
# Day 2 Notes – Vectors & Matrices

Vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

Used in:
- LWE
- Ring-LWE
- Lattice cryptography

Matrices represent linear transformations.

Why important:
Post-quantum schemes rely on matrix and vector operations.
